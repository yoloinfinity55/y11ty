# Getting Started with Eleventy and Modern Web Development

Eleventy (11ty) is a powerful static site generator that allows you to build fast, modern websites using simple, familiar technologies. Unlike traditional CMS platforms, Eleventy generates static HTML files that can be served from any web server or CDN.

## Why Choose Eleventy?

**Performance First**: Static sites load incredibly fast because there's no server-side processing required. Your visitors get instant access to your content.

**Developer Friendly**: Use HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, and your favorite templating languages. No complex setups or steep learning curves.

**Flexible and Extensible**: Add plugins, create custom filters, and integrate with modern build tools like Tailwind CSS.

## Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Template Language Agnostic**: Choose from 11 different template languages
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuilds files that have changed
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extend functionality with community plugins
- **Data Integration**: Pull content from APIs, CMS, or local files

## Getting Started

```bash
# Create a new Eleventy project
npm init -y
npm install @11ty/eleventy

# Add to package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "eleventy",
    "serve": "eleventy --serve"
  }
}
```

This simple setup gives you a powerful foundation for building modern websites. The combination of Eleventy and Tailwind CSS creates a perfect balance of performance and developer experience.
