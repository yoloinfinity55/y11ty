# Getting Started with Static Site Generators

Static site generators have revolutionized the way we build websites. Unlike traditional content management systems that generate pages on-demand, static site generators pre-build all your pages at build time.

## Why Choose a Static Site Generator?

There are several compelling reasons to use a static site generator for your next project:

- **Performance**: Lightning-fast load times since pages are served as static HTML
- **Security**: No database or server-side code to hack
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed anywhere - CDN, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional hosting
- **Developer Experience**: Write in Markdown, focus on content rather than complex setups

## Popular Options

The static site generator landscape is rich with options:

1. **Eleventy (11ty)** - A simpler static site generator that doesn't opinionate your build setup
2. **Next.js** - React-based framework with excellent static generation capabilities
3. **Gatsby** - Another React-based option with a rich plugin ecosystem
4. **Hugo** - Written in Go, extremely fast build times

Each tool has its strengths, but they all share the core principle of generating static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be deployed anywhere.
